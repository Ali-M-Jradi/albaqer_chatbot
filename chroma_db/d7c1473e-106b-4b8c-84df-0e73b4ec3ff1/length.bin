Understanding Gemstone Certificates

Gemstone certificates from recognized labs verify authenticity and quality. Major labs include GIA, AGS, and IGI. Certificates describe the stone's characteristics, any treatments, and origin when possible. Always ask for certificates with valuable stones. Be wary of in-house certificates from sellers. Certificates add value and provide peace of mind for buyers
