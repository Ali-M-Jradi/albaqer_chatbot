How to Care for Silver Jewelry

925 sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver mixed with copper for strength. Silver tarnishes when exposed to air and sulfur compounds. Clean with mild soap and water or specialized silver polish. Store in anti-tarnish bags or cloth. Avoid chlorine, bleach, and harsh chemicals. Regular wearing actually prevents tarnish buildup. Remove before swimming or exercising.d f64
